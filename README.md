"# Shakespearean Text Generator" 
Shakespearean Text Generator
A Deep Learning-based text generation model using LSTMs

📌 Overview
This project implements a character-level text generator trained on Shakespeare's works. It uses a bidirectional LSTM model with dropout regularization to generate text in Shakespearean style. The model learns character sequences and generates text with adjustable creativity using temperature scaling and Top-K sampling.

🚀 Features
✅ Trains an LSTM-based neural network to generate text
✅ Uses temperature scaling to control text randomness
✅ Implements Top-K sampling for better output diversity
✅ Supports custom text length generation
✅ Pretrained model available for direct inference

🏗 Technologies Used
